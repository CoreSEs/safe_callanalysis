## SAFE Call Analysis: SOUND, ANALYSIS, FEELING Demo Component

SAFE Call Analysis is a Demo Component which mocks a call coaching/analysis component. You can upload, visualize and play fictive conversations between a call center agent and a client e.g. Doctor or Patient.

This helps showing how conceptual audio transcriptions and sentiment analysises can be conducted with Einstein Voice or Einstein Call Coaching for example.

Best of all - it is completely configurable via the Lightning Page Layout Builder without the need to change a single line of code.

Check out the documentation for more Information. Looking forward to your feedback.
